## Claims vs Code Reality — READ THIS FIRST

This section is placed first because the gap between README claims and actual implementation is unusually large and affects how every other section should be read.

| README claim | What the code actually does | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| **"Contradiction detection"** — automatically flags inconsistencies against the knowledge graph | `knowledge_graph.py` has **no contradiction detection**. The only dedup is blocking identical open triples (same subject/predicate/object where `valid_to IS NULL`). Conflicting facts (e.g., two different `married_to` values) accumulate silently. | **Feature does not exist** |
| **"30x compression, zero information loss"** — AAAK described as "lossless shorthand" | AAAK is lossy abbreviation: regex entity codes + keyword frequency + 55-char sentence truncation. `decode()` is string splitting — no original text reconstruction. Token counting uses `len(text)//3` heuristic. **LongMemEval drops from 96.6% to 84.2% in AAAK mode** — a 12.4pp quality loss. | **Claim is false** |
| **96.6% LongMemEval R@5** (headline, positioned as MemPalace's score) | Real score, but measured in "raw mode" — uncompressed verbatim text stored in ChromaDB, standard nearest-neighbor retrieval. **The palace structure (wings/rooms/halls) is not involved.** This measures ChromaDB's default embedding model performance, not MemPalace. | **Misleading attribution** |
| **"+34% retrieval boost from palace structure"** | Narrowing search scope from all drawers → wing → wing+room. This is metadata filtering — a standard technique in any vector DB, not a novel retrieval mechanism. | **Misleading framing** |
| **"100% with Haiku rerank"** | Not in the benchmark scripts. Method undocumented and unverifiable from the repo. | **Unverifiable** |
| **"Closets" as compressed summaries** | AAAK produces abbreviations, not summaries. No evidence of a separate closet storage tier distinct from drawers. | **Nomenclature mismatch** |
| **Hall types structurally enforced** | Halls exist as metadata strings but are not used in retrieval ranking or enforced as constraints. | **Conceptual, not functional** |

**Context:** No other system in this survey has this pattern. Systems like Supermemory have transparency caveats (proprietary backend), and many report benchmarks "as reported" without independent verification — but none claim features that provably don't exist in their own code.

---

## TL;DR

- **Core idea**: spatial organization (Wings → Rooms → Halls → Closets → Drawers) as a structural retrieval aid, inspired by the method of loci
- **Storage**: single ChromaDB collection (`mempalace_drawers`) for everything (memories + diary entries), plus SQLite knowledge graph for temporal entity triples
- **Retrieval**: ChromaDB nearest-neighbor with optional metadata filtering by wing/room; no re-ranking, no BM25, no hybrid search
- **Write path**: deterministic chunking (800 chars/100 overlap) + rule-based classification (regex/keyword); no LLM in the extraction pipeline
- **AAAK compression**: entirely rule-based abbreviation (regex + dict lookups + templates); claims "30x, zero information loss" but benchmark shows 12.4% retrieval quality drop
- **Wake-up cost**: genuinely low (~170 tokens for L0+L1) — a real differentiator
- **Headline benchmark is inflated**: 96.6% LongMemEval R@5 is just ChromaDB vector search on uncompressed text; the "palace structure" adds metadata filtering, a standard technique
- **Knowledge graph claims contradiction detection**: code has none; dedup only blocks identical open triples
- **4 test files for 21 modules**, 7 commits total — very early-stage code
- **Zero LLM dependency on write path** — both a strength (no API cost, offline) and a weakness (no semantic extraction, no write gating)

## 1. What's Genuinely Novel

### 1.1 The Spatial Metaphor as Organizing Principle

No other system in this survey uses a spatial/navigational metaphor for memory organization. The Wing/Room/Hall/Tunnel structure provides:

- **Human-legible organization**: a user can reason about "which wing, which room" more intuitively than "which collection, which namespace"
- **Cross-domain connections (tunnels)**: rooms with the same name across wings are automatically linked — a simple but clever heuristic for finding conceptual bridges
- **Hierarchical scoping**: search can be progressively narrowed (all → wing → wing+room) with predictable retrieval quality improvement

The metaphor is genuinely appealing for onboarding and explainability, even if the underlying mechanism is just metadata filtering on ChromaDB.

### 1.2 Extremely Low Wake-Up Cost

The 4-layer stack is well-designed for token economy:

| Layer | Content | Token budget | When loaded |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| L0 | Identity file (`~/.mempalace/identity.txt`) | ~50-100 | Always |
| L1 | Top-15 drawers by importance, grouped by room | ~500-800 | Always |
| L2 | Wing/room-scoped recall | ~200-500 | On topic trigger |
| L3 | Full semantic search | Unbounded | Explicit query |

~600-900 tokens at wake-up leaves >95% of context free. This is better than most systems reviewed: Claude Code loads full MEMORY.md + topic files; OpenViking loads L0 abstracts recursively; ByteRover loads a tiered context tree. MemPalace's approach is closest to ENGRAM's strict evidence budgets but simpler.

### 1.3 Zero-LLM Write Path

All extraction, classification, and compression is deterministic:
- **AAAK compression**: regex entity detection + keyword frequency + sentence scoring + emotion/flag keyword lookup
- **General extractor**: regex-based classification into 5 categories (decisions/preferences/milestones/problems/emotional) with confidence scoring
- **Room detection**: folder path matching → filename matching → keyword scoring → fallback

This means the entire system runs offline with zero API cost on writes. The trade-off is no semantic understanding during extraction.

### 1.4 Agent Diary System

Each agent gets its own wing and timestamped diary entries stored in the same ChromaDB collection (distinguished by metadata `type: diary_entry`). This enables per-agent persistent memory accumulation without a shared scratchpad — similar in spirit to ByteRover's per-project agent pools but simpler.

---

## 2. Architecture

### 2.1 Storage Layer

Everything lives in one ChromaDB persistent collection (`mempalace_drawers`). There is no separate collection per wing, per room, or per type. Diary entries, mined project files, and conversation memories all share the same vector space.

**Metadata schema per drawer:**

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `wing` | Top-level grouping (person/project/topic) |
| `room` | Named topic within a wing |
| `hall` | Memory category (hall_facts, hall_events, etc.) |
| `source_file` | Original file path |
| `chunk_index` | Position within chunked file |
| `added_by` | Agent identifier |
| `filed_at` | ISO timestamp |
| `importance` | Numeric weight (checked during L1 loading) |
| `emotional_weight` | Numeric weight (fallback for L1 scoring) |

**Drawer IDs** are deterministic: `drawer_{wing}_{room}_{md5(source_file + chunk_index)[:16]}`.

### 2.2 Knowledge Graph (SQLite)

Two tables: `entities` (id, name, type, properties) and `triples` (subject, predicate, object, valid_from, valid_to, confidence, source_closet, source_file). Entity IDs are slugified names (`alice_obrien`).

Temporal validity uses string comparison on ISO dates:
```sql
AND (t.valid_from IS NULL OR t.valid_from <= ?)
AND (t.valid_to IS NULL OR t.valid_to >= ?)
```

The graph is inspired by Zep's Graphiti but much simpler: no community detection, no episodic layer, no BFS retrieval, no entity resolution beyond exact slug matching.

### 2.3 Palace Graph (Derived from Metadata)

The "palace graph" (rooms, halls, tunnels) is **not stored as a graph**. It is computed on-demand by scanning ChromaDB metadata in 1000-item batches and building set intersections:

- Two rooms are **connected** if they share a wing (BFS traversal)
- A **tunnel** exists when the same room name appears in 2+ wings
- **Halls** are just metadata labels, not structural entities

This is lightweight but entirely structural — no semantic similarity between rooms, no edge weights, no learned connections.

## 3. Write Path

### 3.1 Project Mining

Files are walked recursively from a project directory. Supported: 20 file extensions (txt, md, py, js, ts, etc.). Skipped: standard build/dep directories.

Room assignment uses a 4-priority cascade:
1. Folder path segment matches a room name
2. Filename stem matches a room name
3. Keyword frequency scoring in first 2000 chars
4. Fallback to `general`

Chunking: 800 chars per chunk, 100 char overlap, paragraph-then-line boundary splitting. Chunks <50 chars are discarded.

**Dedup**: file-level only — if any drawer exists with the same `source_file`, the entire file is skipped. No content-level dedup within the mining pipeline (though the MCP `add_drawer` tool checks vector similarity before inserting).

### 3.2 AAAK Compression

AAAK is a **deterministic abbreviation scheme**, not a compression codec:

1. Entity detection: known name→code mappings, or first-3-chars of capitalized words
2. Topic extraction: word frequency + proper noun boosting, top-3
3. Key sentence selection: decision-keyword scoring, truncated at 55 chars
4. Emotion detection: keyword → abbreviated emotion code
5. Flag detection: keyword → flag label (DECISION, CORE, etc.)

Output format: `wing|room|date|source_stem\n0:ENTITY+ENTITY|topic|"key sentence"|emotion|FLAG`

Token counting uses `len(text) // 3` (heuristic, not real tokenization). The "~30x compression" claim is based on this approximation.

**Critical**: the "decode" method is just string splitting back into a dict. There is no reconstruction of original text. AAAK is lossy.

### 3.3 General Extractor

Rule-based classification into 5 categories via regex scoring:
- Code lines are stripped before scoring
- Segments >500 chars get +2 bonus, >200 get +1
- Confidence = min(1.0, max_score / 5.0); segments below 0.3 are dropped
- Sentiment helper resolves conflicts (problem + resolution keywords → reclassified as milestone)

---

## 4. Read Path

### 4.1 Search

ChromaDB `col.query(query_texts=[query], n_results=N)` with optional `where` filters:
- Wing only: `{"wing": wing}`
- Room only: `{"room": room}`
- Both: `{"$and": [{"wing": wing}, {"room": room}]}`

Distance → similarity: `round(1 - dist, 3)`. No re-ranking, no BM25, no hybrid retrieval. Results are returned in ChromaDB's native order (embedding distance).

### 4.2 Layer Loading

- **L0**: reads `~/.mempalace/identity.txt` — user-authored persona file
- **L1**: queries ChromaDB, scores by `importance`/`emotional_weight`/`weight` metadata, takes top-15 drawers, groups by room, truncates snippets at 200 chars
- **L2**: queries ChromaDB with wing/room filter, truncates at 300 chars
- **L3**: full search (same as 4.1)

### 4.3 Knowledge Graph Queries

- `query_entity(name, as_of, direction)`: outgoing, incoming, or both triples with temporal filtering
- `timeline(entity)`: all triples sorted by valid_from
- `query_relationship(predicate)`: all triples of a given type

No graph traversal in the KG — it's flat triple lookup, not multi-hop.

## 5. Benchmark Assessment

### 5.1 LongMemEval: 96.6% R@5

This is the headline number. What it actually measures:

- **Mode**: "raw" — uncompressed verbatim text stored in ChromaDB
- **Method**: ChromaDB default embedding model, nearest-neighbor retrieval
- **What this tells you**: ChromaDB's default embeddings do very well on LongMemEval's retrieval task when you store the raw text

What it does NOT tell you:
- The "palace structure" is not being tested in raw mode — there's no wing/room filtering
- AAAK-compressed mode scores **84.2%** (12.4pp drop)
- Room-based boosting scores **89.4%** (7.2pp drop from raw)

The "+34% retrieval boost from palace structure" reported in the README comes from a different measurement: searching within progressively narrower scopes on 22K+ memories. This is metadata filtering — a standard technique, not a novel retrieval mechanism.

### 5.2 LoCoMo: 60.3% (Session Granularity, Top-10)

This is mediocre. For comparison:
- HiMem reports 83-89% on LoCoMo (as reported)
- Hindsight reports similarly high scores
- SimpleMem and A-Mem both claim significant LoCoMo improvements

The top-k=50 number (77.8%) is much better but requires loading 5x more context — defeating the token-efficiency argument.

### 5.3 ConvoMem: 92.9%

Only 50 items per category (300 total) with 75K+ QA pairs available. The truncated sample size limits statistical confidence.

### 5.4 Methodological Notes

- No end-to-end QA evaluation (retrieval only — "requires LLM API key")
- No comparison against any baseline system
- No statistical significance testing
- Benchmark scripts are provided and appear runnable — reproducibility is a genuine strength
- The README's "100% with Haiku rerank" claim appears to use an LLM reranker not included in the benchmark scripts

## 6. MCP Server

20 tools across 5 categories — all implemented (no stubs):

- **Palace read** (7): status, search, list wings/rooms, taxonomy, duplicate check, AAAK spec
- **Palace write** (2): add drawer, delete drawer
- **Knowledge graph** (5): query, add, invalidate, timeline, stats
- **Navigation** (3): traverse, find tunnels, graph stats
- **Agent diary** (2): write, read

Notable: the `PALACE_PROTOCOL` string is embedded in the `status` tool output, instructing the AI to "BEFORE RESPONDING about any person...call mempalace_kg_query or mempalace_search FIRST. Never guess — verify." This is a good prompt-engineering practice for grounded retrieval.

The JSON-RPC 2.0 implementation is manual (stdin/stdout line loop), standard MCP transport.

## 7. Comparison Positioning

### Closest Systems in the Survey

| System | Similarity | Key difference |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **ENGRAM** | Typed memory, low token budgets, simple retrieval | ENGRAM uses LLM-routed typed stores; MemPalace uses spatial metaphor with single store |
| **Memoria** | SQLite + ChromaDB, session-based | Memoria has recency weighting + KG triplets; MemPalace has spatial structure + AAAK |
| **Mnemosyne** | Graph memory, lightweight | Mnemosyne has probabilistic decay + refresh; MemPalace has no decay |
| **ClawVault** | Structured markdown, session lifecycle | ClawVault has observation pipeline + task primitives; MemPalace is simpler but less capable |
| **Claude Code memory** | Flat-file memory, typed topics | Claude Code has LLM extraction + team memory; MemPalace has spatial structure + mining |

### What MemPalace Adds to the Design Space

1. **Spatial metaphor as user-facing organization** — no other system uses navigable "rooms"
2. **Zero-LLM write path** — fully offline, zero API cost, deterministic
3. **Verbatim-first philosophy** — "store everything, never summarize" (drawers hold originals)
4. **Very low wake-up cost** — 170 tokens is among the lowest in this survey
5. **Mining pipeline for existing artifacts** — most systems only capture new conversations

### What MemPalace Lacks vs the Field

- **No decay/forgetting** — memories accumulate without recency weighting or pruning
- **No LLM-based extraction** — misses semantic relationships, implicit facts, latent constraints
- **No write gating** — any content can be added without validation or confirmation
- **No dedup beyond file-level** — similar memories accumulate in different chunks
- **No provenance/audit trail** — no correction chains, no versioned updates
- **No multi-hop retrieval** — KG is flat triple lookup, not graph traversal
- **No hybrid search** — ChromaDB only, no BM25/FTS fallback
- **No feedback loops** — no echo/fizzle tracking, no usage-based retention

## 8. Risks and Gaps (Beyond Claims Issues)

### 8.1 Scale Concerns

Everything is in one ChromaDB collection. At 22K drawers the benchmarks work, but:
- The palace graph is computed by scanning all metadata in 1000-item batches — O(n) per graph build
- L1 loading iterates all metadata to find top-15 by importance — O(n) per wake-up
- No indexing strategy for wing/room filtering beyond ChromaDB's built-in

### 8.2 Security

- No write gating or confirmation — MCP `add_drawer` inserts directly
- No input sanitization on drawer content (prompt injection surface)
- No taint tracking or provenance
- The KG `seed_from_entity_facts` method maps dict keys to graph triples without validation

### 8.3 Knowledge Graph Fragility

- Entity ID normalization is naive slug (`alice_obrien`) — no entity resolution
- Row parsing uses hardcoded column indices (`row[10]`, `row[11]`) — brittle
- String date comparison works only with consistent ISO formatting
- No contradiction detection despite README claim

---

## 9. Synthesis Takeaways

### Worth Adopting

- The spatial metaphor is genuinely useful for user-facing organization and could layer on top of more sophisticated backends
- The 4-layer progressive loading pattern with strict token budgets is well-designed
- The "store verbatim, compress separately" pattern avoids premature information loss
- Zero-LLM write path is a legitimate architecture choice for cost-sensitive deployments
- MCP protocol embedding (PALACE_PROTOCOL in status output) is a good integration pattern

### Worth Noting But Not Adopting

- AAAK compression trades retrieval quality for token savings in a way that undermines the "zero information loss" claim; real systems should use LLM-based summarization or structured extraction instead
- The palace graph (derived from metadata set intersections) is too simple for semantic navigation; a real graph should have weighted edges and multi-hop traversal
- The knowledge graph is a useful starting point but needs entity resolution, contradiction detection, and proper column-name-based parsing before production use

### Red Flags for Claims

- The headline 96.6% benchmark is ChromaDB, not MemPalace
- "Zero information loss" is false — AAAK is lossy
- "Contradiction detection" is not implemented
- The 2-day age and 7-commit history suggest this is very early-stage despite the polished README
