# skman — Skill Package Manager

## Overview

Generates spec-compliant, cross-platform agent skills from user requirements. Takes a project/tool name, version, and documentation sources (URLs or filesystem paths), then produces complete SKILL.md files that work on pi, opencode, Claude Code, and Codex.

Skills are Markdown-only by default — no scripts or assets unless the user explicitly requests them.

- **Scripts** — Bash or Python for deterministic tasks (validation, analysis, etc.). Executed by the agent, not loaded into context. Only output consumes tokens.
- **Assets** — Supporting files (docs, schemas, diagrams). Not executed; supplementary material the agent reads when needed.

## When to Use

- Creating a new agent skill for a project, library, or tool
- Converting existing documentation into skill format
- Generating skills from URLs or local codebases
- Updating an existing skill for a new upstream version
- Any task producing `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` files

## Generation Workflow

Follow these steps in order. All paths relative to the skill directory (where SKILL.md lives).

### Step 1: Detect Mode and Validate Input

**New vs update:**
- **New** — No existing directory matches the name. Proceed with full generation.
- **Update** — Existing skill found (e.g., `curl-8-19-0` → `curl-8-20-0`). Read existing SKILL.md, crawl new sources, diff against old content, preserve working sections, update only changed parts. Create a new versioned directory — never overwrite the old one.

**Conflict detection** — Before creating, check `.agents/skills/` for:
- Exact name match → warn user, ask if they meant to update
- Overlapping name without version → suggest versioned naming
- Near-duplicate coverage → note overlap in description

**Name validation** — Must match `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`. Include upstream version hyphenated (e.g., `curl-8-20-0`, `fastapi-0-115`). If no version, use just the name (e.g., `git`).

Valid: `pdf-processing`, `data-analysis` &nbsp;|&nbsp; Invalid: `PDF-Processing`, `-pdf`, `pdf--processing`

### Step 2: Crawl and Collect Content

Gather all source material from the provided URLs and filesystem paths.

**URL crawling** — Recursively follow links within the same domain and subdomains.

**Filesystem crawling** — Recursively visit files and directories.

**Readable extensions:**

| Type | Extensions | Method |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Markdown | `.md`, `.mdx`, `.markdown`, `.mkd` | Direct read |
| RST/Docs | `.rst`, `.adoc` | Direct read (`.rst` may need reconstructing hierarchy from many files) |
| Text | `.txt` | Direct read |
| HTML | `.html`, `.htm` | `pandoc -f html -t markdown`, fallback raw |
| PDF | `.pdf` | `pdftotext -layout` or `gs` |
| Config | `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.json`, `.toml`, `.ini`, `.cfg` | Direct read |
| Code | `.sh`, `.py`, `.c`, `.h`, `.cpp`, `.rs`, `.go`, `.js`, `.ts` | Direct read |
| Man pages | `.1`–`.9` | Direct read |

**Skip:**
- Binary files (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.zip`, `.tar`, `.gz`, `.whl`, `.pyc`, `.so`, `.dll`, `.exe`)
- Hidden files/directories (`.` prefix) unless explicitly requested
- Environment files (`.env`, `.env*`) unless explicitly requested
- Version control (`.git/`, `.svn/`, `.hg/`) always
- **Do not skip by size** — large files may be complex text documents

### Step 3: Determine Structure and Write Output

**Choose structure:**

```
If content has 2+ distinct subtopics AND agent only needs 1-2 per task → complex (SKILL.md + reference/)
If single cohesive topic OR under 300 lines                                    → simple (SKILL.md only)
```

- **Simple**: All content in a single SKILL.md.
- **Complex**: SKILL.md as overview + navigation hub, `reference/` with flat numbered files (`01-*.md`, `02-*.md`).
- **Scripts/assets**: Only if explicitly requested by the user.

**Write YAML header** (exactly two fields):

```yaml
---
name: <skill-name>
description: <1-1024 chars, third person, includes WHAT and WHEN>
---
```

- `name` — Max 64 chars. Must match directory name. Regex `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`.
- `description` — Formula: `[WHAT it does] + [key capabilities] + Use when [specific scenarios].` Aim for 150–400 characters. Third person only. Never "I can help" or "you can use".

**Write SKILL.md body** — Required sections: `## Overview`, `## When to Use`, `## Core Concepts`. Optional sections (include only when applicable): `## Installation / Setup`, `## Usage Examples`, `## Advanced Topics` (only if reference/ exists). See [Templates](reference/03-templates.md) for full templates.

**Write reference files** (if complex) — Flat `reference/` directory, `NN-*.md` naming. Each file: heading, table of contents (if over 100 lines), content. Keep individual reference files under 200 lines — split if longer. All reference files must be linked from SKILL.md. Never chain references (reference → reference).

**Write scripts** (if requested) — See Script Rules below.

### Step 4: Validate

**Run structural validator:**
```bash
bash scripts/validate-skill.sh [--strict] <SKILL_DIR>
```
Checks YAML header, directory layout, file naming, section presence, and script references. Use `--strict` to promote warnings to errors.

**LLM judgment checks** (the script cannot verify these):
- Content accuracy — no hallucinated content, all from crawled sources
- Conciseness — no over-explaining basics the target agent already knows
- Single recommended approach — not multiple options confusing the agent
- Consistent terminology — one term per concept throughout
- Code example quality — correct, copy-pasteable, relevant
- Script clarity — execution intent explicit ("Run" vs "See for reference"), errors handled

### Step 5: Report and Update Index

Report success with file tree and validation results.

**Regenerate the skills table** (after every skill addition, deletion, rename, update, or YAML header edit):
```bash
bash scripts/gen-skills-table.sh [SKILLS_DIR] [README_PATH]
```
Both arguments optional. Defaults: `.agents/skills` and `README.md`.

## Rules

Apply these throughout the workflow.

### YAML Header

- File starts with `---` on line 1, ends header with second `---`.
- Exactly two fields: `name` and `description`.

- `name`: max 64 chars, regex `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`.
- `description`: 1–1024 chars, third person.

### Description Formula

```
[WHAT it does] + [key capabilities, comma-separated] + Use when [specific scenarios].
```

- **WHAT**: Action verb + domain
- **WHEN**: Specific trigger scenarios for skill selection
- **Key terms**: Include distinctive keywords from the project/tool name and primary use cases
- Target 150–400 characters. Under 100 = too vague, over 600 = token waste.

### Directory and Version

- Directory: `<skill-name>` or `<skill-name>-<version>` (e.g., `curl-8-20-0`, `project-2025-11-25`).

### Script Quality

- Handle errors explicitly — never punt to the agent with bare exceptions.
- Document all constants with justification.
- Clear, specific error messages that help the agent fix issues.
- **Execution intent explicit**: "Run `script.py`" (preferred) vs "See `script.py` for reference".
- Prefer execution over reading — deterministic scripts are more reliable than agent-generated equivalents.
- **Python**: `python3 -B script.py`, built-in modules only unless user requests otherwise. For third-party: `uv run python -B script.py`.
- **Naming**: Default script shares skill base name (e.g., `curl` for `curl-8-20-0`). Additional scripts use descriptive names.
- **Help system**: Every script supports `--help`. Subcommands support independent `--help` (e.g., `script subcmd --help`).

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Backslash paths** — Always forward slashes (`reference/guide.md`, not `reference\guide.md`).
- **Too many options** — Single recommended approach in SKILL.md. Alternatives go in reference files.
- **Time-sensitive info** — Don't write "latest version is 3.2". Use labeled "old patterns" section for legacy.
- **Over-explaining basics** — Target agent knows what HTTP, databases, etc. are. Challenge each paragraph: "Does this justify its token cost?"
- **Inconsistent terminology** — One term per concept throughout (always "API endpoint", not sometimes "URL" or "route").

### Cross-Model Compatibility

Generated skills must work on both small and large LLMs:

- **SKILL.md should be scannable in 30 seconds** — every paragraph contains at least one actionable instruction or concrete example.
- **Reference files under 200 lines each** — split if longer.
- **One level of references only** — all link directly from SKILL.md, never reference → reference.
- **Progressive disclosure** — SKILL.md gives quick-start + links to details. Agent loads references only when needed.
- **No chained navigation** — an agent reading SKILL.md should find everything it needs or clear paths to exactly 1–2 reference files.

## Commands

### sync — Sync local .agents/skills with tangled-skills

```bash
bash scripts/sync.sh [TARGET_DIR]
```

Fetches the `main` branch of tangled-skills from GitHub, extracts `.agents/skills/` into `TARGET_DIR/.agents/skills/`, overwriting existing skills with upstream versions. Default target: current directory.

**Dependencies:** bash, curl, tar
