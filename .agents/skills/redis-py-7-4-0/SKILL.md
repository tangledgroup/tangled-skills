# redis-py 7.4

## Overview

redis-py is the official Python client for Redis, the in-memory data store. Version 7.4 supports Python 3.10+ and works with Redis 7.2 through 8.2. It provides a complete Python interface to all Redis commands, including support for standalone, cluster, and sentinel deployments, both synchronous and asynchronous (asyncio) modes, pipelines, pub/sub, Lua scripting, distributed locking, retry logic with configurable backoff strategies, RESP3 protocol features including client-side caching, native OpenTelemetry metrics integration, and access to Redis modules (Bloom, Cuckoo, Count-Min Sketch, TopK, JSON, Search, TimeSeries).

Key capabilities:

- Full Redis command coverage via `CoreCommands` mixin
- Async support through `redis.asyncio`
- Cluster mode via `redis.cluster.RedisCluster`
- Connection pooling with configurable retry and backoff
- Pipeline batching for reduced round-trips
- Pub/Sub messaging
- Lua scripting with automatic cache management
- Distributed locking (`redis.lock.Lock`)
- RESP3 protocol (default from redis-py 8.0+)
- Client-side caching
- Native OpenTelemetry metrics
- Credential providers for dynamic authentication
- SSL/TLS connections with OCSP validation

## When to Use

- Building Python applications that need Redis connectivity for caching, session storage, or message brokering
- Implementing async Redis clients with `asyncio`
- Working with Redis Cluster deployments requiring automatic slot-based routing
- Batching commands through pipelines for performance optimization
- Setting up pub/sub messaging patterns
- Running Lua scripts atomically on the Redis server
- Implementing distributed locks across processes or machines
- Integrating OpenTelemetry observability into Redis-dependent services
- Using Redis modules for probabilistic data structures, JSON operations, full-text search, or time series
- Configuring retry logic with exponential backoff for resilient connections

## Core Concepts

**Client instances are thread-safe** — `Redis` objects can be shared across threads. Connections are retrieved from the pool during command execution and returned immediately after. However, `PubSub` and `Pipeline` objects are not thread-safe.

**Connection pools** — Each `Redis` instance owns its own `ConnectionPool` by default. Share pools across clients using the `connection_pool` parameter, or use `Redis.from_pool()` for exclusive ownership.

**Response decoding** — By default, responses are returned as bytes. Set `decode_responses=True` to receive decoded strings.

**Protocol versions** — RESP3 is the default from redis-py 8.0+. Use `protocol=3` for RESP3 or `protocol=2` for RESP2 on earlier versions. RESP3 provides better performance with fewer type translations and supports new response types (doubles, maps, booleans, push notifications).

**SELECT command not exposed** — redis-py does not implement `SELECT` on client instances because it creates pool contamination. Use separate `Redis` instances (and pools) per database.
